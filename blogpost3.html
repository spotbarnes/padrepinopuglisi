        <p>
            Blessed martyr Giuseppe,<br>

by the grace of God you were<br>

a tireless worker in his vineyard,<br>

a bold witness to the Gospel,<br>

a friend and brother to young people,<br>

defender of the poor and the oppressed.<br><br>

 

Intercede for the Church,<br>

so that the Lord may raise<br>

generous ministers of the Gospel,<br>

men and women capable of working<br>

for real freedom, peace, and the good of everyone.<br><br>

 

Help us too to have<br>
your intrepid courage in renouncing evil<br>

and all compromise with murky human criminal powers,<br>

so that we remain faithful to Christ<br>

and so enter into the glory of his kingdom. Amen.
